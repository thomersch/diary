Diary is a PHP tool that enables you to save your daily photos.

## What does it?

* Not very much. It has a interface that allows you to upload a picture and to add a title, description and date.
* Works well on mobile devices: Everything is optimized for small and big screens. Works perfectly on iOS 6.

## Is it ready to use?

Pretty much. I haven't done very extensive testing, but everything should be ready to go.

## What isn't included?

* Authentication (do it with .htaccess or so)

## What do I need?

* A PHP enabled web server with PHP >= 5.0
